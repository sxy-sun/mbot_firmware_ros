# MBot Firmware (ROS2 Jazzy)
## Project Components
1. `libmicroros`: This directory contains the precompiled micro-ROS static library (`libmicroros.a`) and all necessary header files for the Raspberry Pi Pico. This library includes:
    - ROS 2 client library core functionality
    - Message type definitions
    - Transport layer implementations
    - Serialization/deserialization utilities
2. `microros_static_library`: Contains scripts and configuration files used to generate the `libmicroros` static library. We use it when we need to add customized ros data types. The key components include:
    - `library_generation.sh`: Script that sets up the build environment, compiles micro-ROS packages, and generates the static library
    - `colcon.meta`: Configuration for the colcon build system
    - `toolchain.cmake`: CMake toolchain file for cross-compiling to Raspberry Pi Pico
3. `comms`: Communication Setup
4. `mbot`: MBot Hardware Library
5. `rc` (Robot Control): A library providing essential functions for robot control applications.
6. Supporting Files
    - `available_ros2_types`: A list of all ROS 2 message, service, and action types available in the micro-ROS library
    - `built_packages`: A list of all Git repositories and their specific commit hashes used to build the micro-ROS library

## MicroROS Integration Plan

### Overview
We are transitioning the MBot firmware from using LCM (Lightweight Communications and Marshalling) to using microROS for communication. This will allow the MBot to directly interact with ROS 2 ecosystems without requiring custom bridges or adaptations.

### Directory Structure
- `old_src/`: Original firmware using LCM communication
- `src/`: New microROS-based implementation (in progress)
- `include/config/mbot_classic_config.h`: MBot classic config file
- `mbot/include/mbot/defs/mbot_params.h`: MBot system config file

### Code Modules in `src/`
- `mbot_classic_ros.c/.h`: Core application logic, main loop, hardware interface calls, and microROS node initialization.
- `mbot_ros_comms.c/.h`: Handles all ROS-specific communication aspects including publisher/subscriber/service setup, message initialization, and callbacks.
- `mbot_odometry.c/.h`: Odometry calculation utilities.
- `mbot_print.c/.h`: Debug printing utilities.

### Main Loop (`main()`) Responsibilities
The main `while(1)` loop in `mbot_classic_ros.c` is responsible for:
- Frequently calling `dual_cdc_task()` to service the USB stack.
- Frequently calling `mbot_spin_micro_ros()` (once microROS is initialized) to process ROS events (subscriptions, service calls, and ROS timers).
- Handling other non-blocking tasks like periodic state printing.
Long blocking delays (e.g., `mbot_wait_ms()`) in this loop must be used cautiously to ensure USB and ROS responsiveness.

### Key Technical Considerations
1. **No Custom Message Types**
   - Using only standard ROS 2 message types available in microROS
   - Avoiding custom message definitions to simplify integration

2. **Control Flow Differences**
   - Old: LCM callback-driven architecture
   - New: Timer-based publishing and executor-based subscription handling

3. **Timing Management**
   - Using ROS time synchronization instead of custom timestamps
   - Maintaining fixed-rate control loops (e.g., 25Hz for sensor acquisition and control logic via `mbot_loop`)
   - Periodic ROS state publishing (e.g., 20Hz via `timer_callback` triggered by `ros_publish_timer`)

4. **State Tracking**
   - Using local state variables for robot state (`mbot_state_t`, `mbot_cmd_t`)
   - Synchronizing state between hardware readings and ROS messages (hardware readings update `mbot_state`, ROS messages are populated from `mbot_state`, `mbot_cmd` updated by ROS callbacks).
   Key global state variables:
     - `mbot_state_t mbot_state`: Defined in `mbot_classic_ros.c`, holds the current snapshot of all robot sensor data, odometry, and derived states. Updated by `mbot_loop`. Read by `mbot_publish_state`.
     - `mbot_cmd_t mbot_cmd`: Defined in `mbot_classic_ros.c`, stores the latest commands received via ROS subscriptions. Updated by ROS callbacks in `mbot_ros_comms.c`. Read by motor control logic in `mbot_loop`.
     - `mbot_params_t params`: Stores calibration parameters loaded from FRAM.

## Communication
The firmware uses a single USB Type-C connection with dual CDC (Communication Device Class) interfaces:
1. **Debug Channel** (`/dev/ttyACM0`):
   - Used for firmware debug messages and status prints
   - Accessible via standard serial tools: `sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200`

2. **MicroROS Channel** (`/dev/ttyACM1`):
   - Dedicated to microROS communication
   - Handles all ROS2 messages and services
   - Used by micro-ros-agent for ROS2 bridge

This dual-channel approach allows simultaneous debugging and ROS communication without additional hardware connections.

### Important: Servicing TinyUSB and Using `sleep_ms`

**TinyUSB (the USB stack used for CDC communication) requires frequent servicing via `tud_task()` (`dual_cdc_task()`).**
If the USB stack is not serviced regularly (ideally every 1â€“10 ms), the host computer may think the device is unresponsive and disconnect the serial ports (`/dev/ttyACM0`, `/dev/ttyACM1`).

**Do NOT use long `sleep_ms()` calls.**

#### **Incorrect Usage (will cause USB ports to disappear):**
```c
// BAD: This will block USB for 2 seconds!
sleep_ms(2000);
```

#### **Correct Usage (keeps USB alive):**
Use the wait function we provide.
```c
#include "comms/dual_cdc.h";
mbot_wait_ms(2000);
```

## Time 
- `mbot_state.timestamp_us` is the last time the mbot_state was updated by `mbot_loop`.
- `mbot_state.last_encoder_time` is the Pico local time recorded at the start of the encoder read in `mbot_loop`, used for calculating `encoder_delta_t`.
- `now` variable (local to `mbot_publish_state` function) holds the ROS-synchronized epoch time obtained via `rmw_uros_epoch_nanos()`, used for timestamping outgoing ROS messages.
